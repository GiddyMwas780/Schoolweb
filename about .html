With hearts both strong and true,
Service be our earnest endeavor,
And our homeland of Kenya,
Heritage of splendor,
Firm may we stand to defend.

In common bond united,
Build this our nation together,
In peace, love, and harmony,
As we stand and make this pledge,
To Kenya, our motherland, we defend
