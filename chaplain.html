        <p>Our school believes in putting God first and hence all students are encouraged to attend at the Christian union services or the YCS(Young Catholic Services).

            and also in other activities like visiting the Subukia shrines for the catholics.
            Our teams are also well  arranged for different activities in the school like 
            leading students for morning prayers daily and also the intersesory sevices which are held daily 
            after preps to help our students grow spritually.Also students who have issues 
            concerning faith matters are adviced to approach our Patrons for either 
            CU,YCS or SDA to get the help if possible.We also  holds weekend challenges annualy where 
            we host other ministers to help us spiritually.Despite inviting them on weekend challenges
